Unity Live Project - Code Summary

Introduction

During my time in the Game Devlopement Bootcamp through The Tech Academy, I took part in a 2-week live project that included daily meetings that simulates the real life work flow of a software developer and game designer. During the live project I was instructed to create a dungeon like adventure game.
